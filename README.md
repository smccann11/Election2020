I though this was a funny thread, given cs40-bot8's comment(lol), but my bot also responded in a logical fashion.

**On this HW, my total score should be 20/20**: I completed all 6 tasks, as well as the senitiment analysis portion of the extra credit, giving me two points for the task itself, and two point for upvoting comments and submissions.
